# Text Concordance Project
A text concordance is an alphabetical listing of all distinct words in a piece of text. I wrote a program to construct a concordance for a document stored in a file. The words are stored in an array/vector of 26 binary search trees. Part of each node of the BST has a circular linked list queue.
 
## Implementation:
Be sure to include all files within same directory
