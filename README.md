# Text Concordance Project
A text concordance is an alphabetical listing of all distinct words in a piece of text. I wrote a program to construct a concordance for a document stored in a file. The words are stored in an array/vector of 26 binary search trees. Part of each node of the BST has a circular linked list queue.
 
## Implementation:
Be sure to include all files within same directory before running code. Recommended IDE: Visual Studio 2019. However, you may use any IDE of your choice. 

In Visual Studio:

1) Create a new project folder
2) Add the files into project folder
3) In menu bar, under 'Debug' select and click on 'Run without Debugging'
