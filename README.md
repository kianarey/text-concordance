# Text Concordance Project
A text concordance is an alphabetical listing of all distinct words in a piece of text. In this project, I wrote a program to construct a concordance for a text document stored in a file. Words are stored in an array/vector of 26 binary search trees. Part of each node of the BST has a circular linked list queue.
 
#### How to Run Code:
Include all files within same directory before running code. Recommended IDE: Visual Studio 2019. 

After downloading files, in Visual Studio:

1) Create a new project folder
2) Add the files into project folder
3) Using Console as output window, in the menu bar, under 'Debug' select and click on 'Run without Debugging'
